# 370CT_Dining_Philosopher
A semaphore solution to synchronize the concurrent activities of the three men who are sitting on a circular table, with 3 soldering irons, one to the left and one to the right. To do the soldering, they need both left and right soldering irons. Those that donâ€™t have the soldering iron will have to wait until both are available. 

## How to run this program? 
1. Run `g++ -std=c++17 solution.cpp -o solution.out` to compile the program.
2. Run `./solution.out <Number of workers>` to execute the program. Replace `Number of workers` with the actual number of workers.
